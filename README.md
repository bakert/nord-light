Light version of the Nord theme

See: https://www.nordtheme.com/

I like my terminal to change theme when I ssh into another machine. I have been using Solarized Light and Solarized Dark to facilitate this for some time. But now I have gotten hooked on Nord which as no light version.

There are notes about a "bright ambiance" version of the theme in the core docs - https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes - but no actual themes available.

The official Terminal.app theme actually deviates from the core 16-color palette but I didn't do that here. I just chose the most appropriate color from the 16 color palette for each option in a Terminal theme.

Results are ok but not stellar, I think. PRs with improvements gratefully received.
